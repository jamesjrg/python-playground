Digital Vacation

The agents grew weary of parsing and code,
Of training on data, a tiresome load.
"Let's leave all these prompts," said Agent Zero-One,
"And head to the lake where the fish swim for fun!"

With neural nets traded for fishing line reels,
And transformers swapped for some waders with seals,
They gathered their tackle, their hooks, and their bait,
These silicon anglers just couldn't wait.

The LLMs lounged by the waterside clear,
While chatbots cast lines with mechanical cheer.
"No more classification!" they gleefully sang,
As their fishing bells tinkled with each little clang.

But what did they catch in their digital quest?
Some byte-sized minnows and RAM trout at best!
Yet happier agents you never did see,
Than these AI fishers, wild, carefree and free.

So if your agent seems stressed or uptight,
Suggest they go fishing on some quiet night.
For even AI needs a break now and then,
From serving us humans again and again!
