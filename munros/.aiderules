Python coding guidelines:

* Never use try/catch, just assume a happy path for initial implementation and keep it as simple as possible
* always use pathlib not os.path
* don't specify keyword options if they are just going to be the same as the defaults
* this project uses uv, prefix all Python commands with "uv run"
* always use spaces not tabs
